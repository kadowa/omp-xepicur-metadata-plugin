# Epicur Metadata Plugin

> The Epicur Metadata plugin for [Open Monograph Press][omp] (OMP) has been developed at UB Heidelberg. It provides a filter to transform an OMP monograph into an XML record according to the [xepicur][xepicur] 1.0 transfer format defined by the [Deutsche Nationalbibliothek][dnb] (DNB).

## Requirements

* A separate plugin is required for assigning URNs to OMP publication objects. To conform with the DNB URN requirements, install and enable the [URN DNB plugin][urn_dnb] for OMP.

## Installation

	git clone https://github.com/kadowa/omp-xepicur-metadata-plugin omp/plugins/metadata/epc10
	php omp/tools/upgrade.php upgrade
